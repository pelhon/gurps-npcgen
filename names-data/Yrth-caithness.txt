Caithness parents typically follow the customs of their Megalan

ancestors (p. 88) when naming children. However, fanciful names some-
times occur . . . resurrected from old tales, or just invented . . . particu-
larly among noble families. Examples include Aylara, Bandellan,

Galardon, Pinetall, Renown, Torrion, and Vulnavia. These names
become common if they sound good, especially if the holder becomes
admired. For instance, Peredur of Durham, famed as Peredur Orcslayer,
was the first on Yrth to bear that name, but Peredur is now a common
name, particularly among those born immediately after his death in
1989.
