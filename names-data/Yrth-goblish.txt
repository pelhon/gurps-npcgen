Except in rural areas, Megalan goblins no longer use their ancestral
language except for names. However, some goblin nobles have Latin or
part-Latin names, such as Jelkejek Viridis (“The Green”). Many humans
in goblin fiefdoms also have goblin names. Common ones include
Baajikiil, Dakiiri, Gykkii, Jandig, K’jaakis, K’tiiki, Potiij, Shiikus,
Toov’tekki, Viitagi, Yig’oor, and Yivirrl. Goblin names typically have no
assigned gender. In general, consonant sounds are explosive, vowels are
long, and most names have two or three syllables.
