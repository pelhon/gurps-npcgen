Aralaise naming mostly follows Megalan patterns (p. 88), save that
the nobility do not borrow from Latin and all names have a strong,
proud French flavor. Epithets referring to a place use the preposition
“de” rather than “of” – hence “Arnod de Sauvons.” When the place name
begins with a vowel, this is abbreviated, as in “Remis d’Ansonne.”
Typical male names include Aramis, Arnod, Bernard, Etienne, Guy,
Henri, Jacques, Louis, Mathieu, Michel, Philippe, Raymonde, Thibod,
Thierry, and Xavier. Women’s names include Allisende, Anne,
Bernadette, Danielle, Giselle, Jeanne, Lisette, Marie, Monique, and
Sybille.
In some outlying regions, fragments of Asian naming systems survive.
A first child will sometimes be called “Wayan” or “Putu” and a second
“Made” or “Kadek,” regardless of sex, in the Balinese tradition.
