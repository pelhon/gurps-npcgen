Commoners

Most people are known by one name, with an epithet added – a
descriptive word or phrase. A few families adopt epithets as true family
names. Most names are Celtic, Norman, or Anglo-Saxon in origin,
though spelling may vary.
Some common male names are Alfric, Andre, Ashe, Bruce, Bryan,
Edward, Evan, Cerdic, Donnwulf, Francis, Geoffrey, Giles, Hal, Hugh,
John, Lyon, Marc, Morgan, Niall, Olen, Osric, Rann, Sean, Trent, Wade,
Warren, and Yrving.
Women’s names include Adea, Alyce, Blanche, Bronwyn, Cathyn,
Ceredyn, Giselle, Juliet, Justina, Katha, Maye, Norla, Pearl, Rosemary,
Susanna, Vylette, and Yrena.
Epithets take several common forms: place of birth (John o’ the
Lake); occupation (Donal Coppersmith); appearance (Merid Redlocks);
deeds (Justina Wolfslayer); parentage (Carre Half-Elven); and habits
(Adolph Ear-Puller).
Such additions often evolve over a lifetime. Justina Wolfslayer was
simply Justina until she was 12. When she started to go to market with
her family, she was Justina of Trent. Her love of the bow made her
Justina the Archer. Then, one winter, she killed a dozen wolves in two
days, acquiring her current name.
Nobles

Nobles always have at least one epithet, often a true family name. A
noble’s peers frequently call him by the name of his fiefdom: Count
Darius of Kethalos is simply “Kethalos” to other nobles.

Most Megalan nobles speak Latin, and many noble children (espe-
cially eldest sons) receive Roman-flavored names. Common Latin-style

male names include Aloysius, Claudius, Flavius, Honorius, Julian, Leo,
Marcus, Procopius, Rufus, Tiberias, Titus, and Valerian. Women rarely
receive Latin names.
